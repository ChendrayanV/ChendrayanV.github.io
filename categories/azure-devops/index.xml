      <description>Introduction I have no access to my organization DevOps due to unfortunate technical issues, but that didnâ€™t stop me from working. This morning I was on a call with a business owner who asked me to show the steps to create service connections with the certificate.

      <description>Introduction There is always an alternative is the apt statement to start this blog post! Yes, I got trouble in VPN and lost connection to most of our internal portal, and one among that is Azure DevOps (Formerly VSTS), where the code resides. Positively, no hindrances in accessing Outlook and Teams over mobile. All I need is to continue the work on code, work items and send status report.
 REST API is the savior!</description>
