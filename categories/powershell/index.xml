      <description>Introduction Recently I was asked to build a PowerShell script for retrieving Azure virtual machines which has no Just In Time (JIT) access enabled. Yes, it’s for security auditing team. I searched in PowerShell Gallery, TechNet Gallery and other sources and didn’t find one. So, obvious is to develop one and share to community.
Solution First, I thought of retreiving virtual machines and query against JIT Access Policy REST API endpoint.</description>
