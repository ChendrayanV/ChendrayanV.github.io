      <description>Of late, I was in need to use a PFX in the Azure DevOps pipeline. Well, it’s not super complex, and having said that, it’s not relatively easy. What do we learn in this blog post? A simple PowerShell script to use a PFX certificate in the Azure DevOps PowerShell script task. Let me try to explain the steps as most effortless as possible.

I searched in PowerShell Gallery, TechNet Gallery, and other sources and didn’t find one. So, I developed a script that may help you!
Solution First, I thought of retrieving virtual machines and query against the JIT Access Policy REST API endpoint. But it&amp;rsquo;s not required!</description>
