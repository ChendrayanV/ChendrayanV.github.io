      <description>Introduction A colleague of mine asked a solution for raising a service request in SNOW (Service Now) for each NSG rule creation and deletion.

      <description>Introduction As part of the cost saving project task, I developed a PowerShell script to retrieve UNATTACHED disks. I used JOIN operator in this code to get a few tag information from the respective resource group.
 Replace value for the {TAGNAME}.
 $Query = &amp;#34;Resources | where type =~ &amp;#39;Microsoft.Compute/disks&amp;#39; | where properties.diskState =~ &amp;#39;Unattached&amp;#39; | project id, name, subscriptionId, resourceGroup, diskInGB = properties.diskSizeGB, diskState = properties.diskState, timeCreated = properties.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have no access to my organization DevOps due to unfortunate technical issues, but that didnâ€™t stop me from working. This morning I was on a call with a business owner who asked me to show the steps to create service connections with the certificate. Yes, I have to use the OPEN SSL tool to convert the PFX to PEM, and it was a bit difficult for me to walk him through the steps remotely.</description>

      <description>Introduction There is always an alternative is the apt statement to start this blog post! Yes, I got trouble in VPN and lost connection to most of our internal portal, and one among that is Azure DevOps (Formerly VSTS), where the code resides. Positively, no hindrances in accessing Outlook and Teams over mobile. All I need is to continue the work on code, work items and send status report.
 REST API is the savior!</description>
